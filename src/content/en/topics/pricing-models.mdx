# Pricing Models

How glyph pricing works on Glyphrun.

## Available Models

### Per-Run

Fixed price for each execution.

```typescript
{
  model: 'per-run',
  amount: 0.05,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**How it works:**
- Same price every time
- Regardless of input/output size
- Most predictable for users

**Best for:**
- Most glyphs
- Predictable costs
- Simple pricing

### Per-Token

Price based on input and output tokens.

```typescript
{
  model: 'per-token',
  amount: 0.001, // per 1K tokens
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**How it works:**
- Cost scales with content length
- Input + output tokens counted
- More variable pricing

**Best for:**
- Variable-length outputs
- Pass-through pricing
- Usage-based billing

### Per-Second

Price based on execution time.

```typescript
{
  model: 'per-second',
  amount: 0.01,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**How it works:**
- Cost scales with time
- Execution time measured
- Good for compute tasks

**Best for:**
- Long-running agents
- Compute-intensive tasks
- Time-based resources

### Free

No cost to execute.

```typescript
{
  model: 'free',
  amount: 0,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**How it works:**
- No charge to users
- Creator pays any API costs
- Good for building audience

**Best for:**
- Demo/trial glyphs
- Open source tools
- Building reputation

## Dynamic Pricing

### Estimators

Show estimated cost before running:

```typescript
{
  estimatedCost: '~$0.05 per run'
}
```

### Variable Costs

For token-based pricing, estimate range:

```typescript
{
  minCost: 0.01,
  maxCost: 0.50,
  typicalCost: 0.05
}
```

## User Experience
