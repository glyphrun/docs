# Welcome to Glyphrun

Glyphrun is the **App Store for AI Agents** - a marketplace for Runnable Digital Assets (RDAs) called **Glyphs**.

Think of it as an App Store where every app is an AI capability you can run instantly with USDC micropayments.

## What is a Glyph?

A Glyph is a packaged AI capability that you can run with a single click. Glyphs come in three types:

| **Agents** | Workflow orchestration via webhooks | Automated trading, multi-step tasks, data pipelines |
| **Tools** | API proxies with payment handling | Blockchain queries, social analytics, price feeds |

## Categories

Glyphs are organized by outcome:

- **LAUNCH** - For builders: Token engineering, community management, launch planning
- **SECURE** - For auditors: Contract audits, identity verification, security analysis
- **OPTIMIZE** - For traders: DeFi strategies, yield optimization, market analysis
