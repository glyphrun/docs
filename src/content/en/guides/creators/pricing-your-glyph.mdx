# Pricing Your Glyph

Set competitive pricing that reflects value and covers costs.

## Pricing Models

### Per-Run (Recommended)

Fixed price per execution:

```typescript
pricing: {
  model: 'per-run',
  amount: 0.05,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**Best for:**
- Prompts with predictable costs
- Tools with fixed API costs
- Simple, consistent outputs

### Per-Token

Cost based on input/output tokens:

```typescript
pricing: {
  model: 'per-token',
  amount: 0.001, // per 1K tokens
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**Best for:**
- Variable-length prompts
- Cost pass-through scenarios

### Per-Second

Cost based on execution time:

```typescript
pricing: {
  model: 'per-second',
  amount: 0.01,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**Best for:**
- Long-running agents
- Compute-intensive tasks

### Free

No cost to run:

```typescript
pricing: {
  model: 'free',
  amount: 0,
  currency: 'USDC'
}
```

**Best for:**
- Building reputation
- Open source tools
- Limited functionality demos

## Model Tiers (Prompts Only)

For prompt glyphs, users choose model tiers:

| Tier | Your Revenue | Platform Fee |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Fast ($0.02) | ~$0.018 | ~$0.002 |
| Balanced ($0.05) | ~$0.045 | ~$0.005 |
| Reasoning ($0.10) | ~$0.09 | ~$0.01 |

## Pricing Strategy

### Cost Calculation

Factor in your costs:

1. **API Costs**
   - LLM API costs (for prompts)
   - External API costs (for tools)
   - Infrastructure costs (for agents)

2. **Time Investment**
   - Development time
   - Maintenance effort
   - Support time

3. **Value Delivered**
   - Time saved for users
   - Quality of output
   - Uniqueness of capability

### Market Research

Check comparable glyphs:

1. Browse similar glyphs in marketplace
2. Note their pricing
3. Consider your differentiators
4. Price competitively

### Starting Point

Suggested starting prices:

| Type | Simple | Medium | Complex |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| Prompts | $0.02-0.05 | $0.05-0.10 | $0.10+ |
| Agents | $0.05-0.10 | $0.10-0.25 | $0.25+ |
| Tools | $0.01-0.03 | $0.03-0.10 | $0.10+ |

## Source Code Pricing (Prompts)

Offer your prompt template for sale:

```typescript
promptSourcePrice: 4.99 // One-time purchase
```

### Pricing Factors

- **Uniqueness** - How novel is your approach?
- **Complexity** - How much engineering went in?
- **Value** - How much would users save?

### Suggested Prices

| Complexity | Price |
|------------|-------|
| Simple | $1.99 - $4.99 |
| Medium | $4.99 - $9.99 |
| Complex | $9.99 - $24.99 |

## Revenue & Fees

- **USDC** - To your connected wallet
- **No minimums** - Withdraw anytime

## Optimization Tips

### Price Testing

1. Start with competitive pricing
2. Monitor run volume
3. Adjust based on demand
4. Consider A/B testing

### Value Perception

- **Quality descriptions** - Explain the value
- **Good examples** - Show what users get
- **Verified badge** - Build trust

### Volume vs. Margin

- **Lower price** - More runs, lower margin
- **Higher price** - Fewer runs, higher margin
- **Find balance** - Test and optimize

## Analytics

Track your glyph performance:

- **Total runs** - How often it's used
- **Revenue** - Earnings over time
- **Rating** - User satisfaction
- **Success rate** - Reliability

Use analytics to inform pricing decisions.

## Common Mistakes

### Pricing Too High

- Users won't try it
- No reviews/ratings
- Low discoverability

### Pricing Too Low

- Unsustainable
- Perceived as low quality
- Race to bottom

### Ignoring Costs

- API costs add up
- Infrastructure costs
- Support time
