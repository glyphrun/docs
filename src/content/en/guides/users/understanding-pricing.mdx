# Understanding Pricing

Learn how pricing works on Glyphrun.

## Pricing Models

Glyphs can use different pricing models:

### Per-Run Pricing

Fixed cost per execution:

- **Example**: $0.05 per run
- **Predictable** - Know the cost upfront
- **Most common** - Used by most glyphs

### Per-Token Pricing

Cost based on input/output tokens:

- **Example**: $0.001 per 1K tokens
- **Variable** - Depends on content length
- **Used by**: Some prompt glyphs

### Per-Second Pricing

Cost based on execution time:

- **Example**: $0.01 per second
- **Variable** - Depends on task complexity
- **Used by**: Some agent glyphs

### Free

No cost to run:

- **Good for**: Trying new glyphs
- **May have**: Usage limits
- **Creators use for**: Building reputation

## Model Tiers (Prompts)

Prompt glyphs offer different model tiers:

| Tier | Price | Models | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Fast** | $0.02/run | GPT-4o Mini, Claude Haiku, Llama 8B | Simple tasks |
| **Balanced** | $0.05/run | GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 70B | Most use cases |
| **Reasoning** | $0.10/run | o1-preview, Claude Opus, Llama 405B | Complex analysis |

## Cost Estimation

### Before Running

The glyph page shows:

- **Base price** - Minimum cost
- **Model tier prices** - For prompts
- **Estimated cost** - Based on typical usage

### During Execution

The Run button shows:

- **Exact cost** - What will be charged
- **Your balance** - Current available funds

## What Affects Cost

### For Prompts

- **Model tier** - Fast < Balanced < Reasoning
- **Input length** - More text = higher cost
- **Output length** - Longer responses cost more

### For Agents

- **Base price** - Set by creator
- **Execution time** - For time-based pricing
- **External API costs** - Built into price

### For Tools

- **Base price** - Set by creator
- **API rate limits** - May affect pricing
- **Data volume** - For data-heavy tools

## Payment Flow

### How It Works

1. **Lock** - Amount is locked when you click Run
2. **Execute** - Glyph runs
3. **Success** - Locked amount is deducted
4. **Failure** - Locked amount is released back

### Failed Runs

If a glyph fails:

- You're NOT charged
- Locked funds are released
- Balance is restored immediately

## Creator Earnings

When you run a glyph:

- **Creator receives** - Majority of the payment
- **Platform fee** - Small percentage
- **Instant settlement** - Creators paid immediately

## Tips for Cost Optimization

### Choose the Right Tier

- Use **Fast** for simple tasks
- Use **Balanced** for most work
- Save **Reasoning** for complex analysis

### Test with Examples

- Check Examples tab first
- Understand expected costs
- Start with simpler inputs

### Monitor Spending

- Set spending limits
- Review transaction history
- Track monthly spending

## Comparing Costs

### Traditional AI APIs

| Service | Cost per 1K tokens |
|---------|-------------------|
| OpenAI GPT-4 | ~$0.03 |
| Anthropic Claude | ~$0.015 |
| Direct API | Variable |

### Glyphrun

- **Bundled pricing** - No token counting
- **Predictable costs** - Fixed per-run prices
- **No API keys** - Use immediately
