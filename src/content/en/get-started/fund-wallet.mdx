# Fund Your Wallet

To run glyphs, you need USDC in your Glyphrun wallet.

## Supported Currency

- **USDC** - USD Coin on Base network
- **Network** - Base (Coinbase L2)
- **Minimum** - No minimum deposit

## How to Deposit

### From External Wallet

1. Go to [Account > Wallet](https://glyphrun.com/account/wallet)
2. Copy your Glyphrun wallet address
3. Send USDC on Base network to this address
4. Wait for confirmation (~2 seconds)

### Bridge from Other Networks

If your USDC is on Ethereum, Polygon, or other networks:

1. Use [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) to bridge to Base
2. Send bridged USDC to your Glyphrun wallet

### Purchase with Card

Coming soon - purchase USDC directly with credit/debit card.

## Spending Allowance

Glyphrun uses a spending allowance system:

- **Default Allowance** - $10 initial limit
- **Per-Transaction Limit** - Configurable maximum per glyph run
- **No Per-Transaction Signing** - Seamless UX once funded

### How It Works

1. Deposit USDC to your wallet
2. Set your spending allowance (default $10)
3. Run glyphs without signing each transaction
4. Balance is automatically deducted

## Check Your Balance

View your wallet status at [Account > Wallet](https://glyphrun.com/account/wallet):

- **Balance** - Total USDC available
- **Available** - Amount available for spending
- **Locked** - Amount locked in pending transactions

## API Access

Check balance programmatically:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.glyphrun.com/wallet/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "wallet": {
    "balance": 100.50,
    "availableBalance": 95.00,
    "totalLocked": 5.50
  }
}
```
